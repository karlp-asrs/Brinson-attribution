### Institutional portfolio performance attribution analysis

The files here illustrate Brinson performance attribution.

Institutional investment portfolios are typically constructed with a strategic asset allocation which prescribes assets classes for investment, policy weights for each asset class and policy benchmarks for each asset class. The portfolio benchmark is simply the sum of the policy weights times the policy benchmark returns, i.e. the weighted average of the benchmark returns.  Actual portfolios will have performance which varies from benchmark because actual weight of asset classes within the portfolio may vary from policy weights and the actual returns of asset class portfolios may vary from benchmark returns.

The basic construct of Brinson analaysis is straightforward and reflected in this formula:

$$(R+\Delta R) * (W+\DeltaW) = Total Return$$

where R is the benchmark return, W is the policy weight and the deltas are the difference between policy or benchmark and actual.
